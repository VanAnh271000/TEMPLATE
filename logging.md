# Logging & Observability

## Logging Strategy
- Structured logging with Serilog
- Logs sent to Seq

## Correlation ID
- Automatically generated per request
- Propagated across logs
- Helps trace a request across services

## Performance Logging
- Log slow requests
- Log execution time of critical operations

## Log Levels
- Information: business events
- Warning: recoverable issues
- Error: failures
